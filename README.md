# Full_Stack_Project
My first full-stack project

This repository consists of the backend and frontend code. It is just for demonstration purposes.
The integration of the backend and frontend is done through the RESTful API.



Backend:
Created with the Spring Boot framework. It consists of a Controller, Model, and Repository.
Utilizes the Spring Data JPA repository and MySQL.
GET and POST HTTP methods are available to invoke through the UI.

Frontend:
Created with the React.js and Materialized framework.
